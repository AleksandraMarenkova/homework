<div></div><big>Our course will mainly cover the Classical American Poetry and literature in general.</big> <dt><b><i>American literature</b></i></dt><dd><small>is literature predominantly written or produced in English in the United States of America and its preceding colonies. Before the founding of the United States, the Thirteen Colonies on the eastern coast of the present-day United States were heavily influenced by British literature. The American literary tradition thus is part of the broader tradition of English-language literature. A small amount of literature exists in other immigrant languages. Furthermore a rich tradition of oral storytelling exists amongst Native American tribes.</small></dd></div>
